[0.4.42.28]
  - XA Morphs preview
  - Scrolling to newly added morph keyframes after import of morphs. Also scrolling to imported morph clip.
  - DirectX export/import integrated and fixed
  - DAE Collada (FBX SDK) export/import integrated

[0.4.42.27]
  - Saving a pp file caused crashes on subsequent openings of subfiles (XX and XA). (No data corruption in the pp file.)
  - XX ReplaceMesh corrupted XX unit when replacing a mesh with NumVector2PerVertex==0 or when inserting a new mesh.
  - PP saving failed in the same session after deletion of last backup file.
  - XX deleting last bone crashed (hightlighting).

  - FBX morph export can apply keyframes as channels of only one blendshape.
  - FBX import reads old and newly organized files, but not mixed.
  - New keyframes can be imported.
  - Added calculation of normals for morphs in XAs.
  - Added editing of xaMorphKeyframeRef components and names of xaMorphKeyframes.
  - Change: "fixed" size of the renderer's cursor
  - Added fine grained zoom in renderer. Activated by ALT-RMB
  - Both zoom functions are taking Sensitivity into account.

[0.4.42.26]
  - FBX morph imports didn't show the morph names. Export fixed, but the files cant be imported by the old SB3U.
  - MQO morph export set wrong material index.

[0.4.42.25]
  - XX format conversion fixed

[0.4.42.24]
  - changing defaults to "Copy Nearest" for normals/bones for imported meshes without normals/bones (XX, ODF, REM)
  - Fbx got a second set of functions for keyframe interpolation, export and import which works with Imported structures.
  - HET DTL support

[0.4.42.22]
  - prevented loosing keyboard focus in image lists (pp subfiles, image file lists, fpk subfiles)
  - nearly all GUI elements can be tabbed
  - assert visibility of the Renderer when selecting a mesh
  - Light colours and menu options for Renderer, Script, XX and PP stored SB3UtilityGUI.exe.config
  - Center View corrected and adjusted
  - useless editor.Set{Frame|Bone|Material|Texture}Name() no longer invoked
  - extended script language to allow hex int32, e.i. '0x1F'

[0.4.42.21]
  - Export of morphs as fbx and mqo with the GUI

[0.4.42.20]
  - FBX InterpolationHelper class aligns tracks for exporting compressed animations
  - Issue: FbxProperties for SRT have to be created outside of the class as they seem to be put on the stack.

[0.4.42.19]
  - GUI : removing the last (and also used) material caused an error in DataGridViewMesh
  - GUI : removed explicit activation of the renderer upon mesh selection change
  - GUI : added automatic centering of the renderer view after mesh selection change

[0.4.42.18]
  - tab stops in frame, bone, mesh, material and texture editors didn't work
  - added keyframe range for fbx export of animations

[0.4.42.17]
  - Some scripting variables weren't released and prevented GC to tidy up.
  - Added help for GC in FormXX. Memory is faster released for external XX files.
  - Opening/dropping the same XX/XA files again closes the previously opened editor.
  - Sound handling moved into it's own class

[0.4.42.16]
  - sound tab wasn't considered by menu actions

[0.4.42.15]
  - format of pp files entirely made up of sounds wasn't correctly detected
  - playing sounds via irrKlang library

[0.4.42.14]
  - Copy->New bones crashed the Renderer.

[0.4.42.13a]
  - reopening image didn't update internal variable (GUItexture).

[0.4.42.12]
  - JCH animation files for AA couldn't be opened
  - saving pp files after opening an XA (having morphs or animations) corrupted the XA
  - script commands only executable in the GUI are marked with a comment

[0.4.42.11]
  - added more hotkeys and shortcuts
  - texture display was not refreshed after ReplaceTexture
  - added quick save script / run quick saved
  - ppEdtitor.SavePP() deleted the pp file in the current directory
  - ExportPP() couldn't work in the current directory
  - added shortcut key to attribute PluginTool
  known issues:
  - drag 'n drop doesn't work in the script window and log window
  - shortcut keys dont work in the script window and log window

[0.4.42.10]
  Fixes:
  - replacing/adding compressed tga images
  - CTRL-V pasted twice in hex editor (COPY-C did the same)
  Change:
  - added menu to xx editor for reopening, saving, closing
  - added menu to image files for reopening and closing
  - pp menu got hotkeys

[0.4.42.9]
  Fixes:
  - Frame and bone matrices can be edited on SRT and Matrix; updating the corresponding matrix after each input of a cell
  - CopyNormalsNear, CopyBonesNear didn't find Normals/Bones for destination vertices exceeding source vertices
  - Replace mesh couldn't compute matrix transform for world coordinates option
  - Changes in frame's and bone's SRTs not applied : dataGridViews for SRT and Matrix update each other after CellValueChanged
  - Names in cross references abbreviated after renaming (ended with '...')
  - Removing a material didn't clear the editor

[0.4.42.8] - showing 0.4.42.7 in the title
  Fix:
  - replacing xa morphs: new name of morph clip assigned only when destination was unchanged
  Change:
  - added HF logo

[0.4.42.7]
  Fixes:
  - fbx import: missing texture file raised uncaught exception
  - pp format: autodection for .LST files
  - workspace: creation of empty workspace from menu
  - xa files: failed when opened (casted to xxParser)
  - invalid material indices couldn't be set to valid indices
  - export of textures landed in parent folder with wrong name
  Changes:
  - pp files: created an AddSubfile with replace argument. Works now like in the old SB3U.
  - external textures are not fixed by setting material's references to null. A button in the material view allow editing external texuture names. Added by request.
  - pp files: dialog for exporting of subfiles starts folder of pp file
  - Interface IRenderer exposes ResetPose - required for ODF/ODA animation, since rewinding time to 0.0 doesn't lead to the rest pose

[SB3Ur442p133]
  - fix for exporting Textures

[SB3Ur442p131]
  - fix for Happy End Trigger Trial.

[SB3Ur442p128]
  - support for Happy End Trigger Trial
